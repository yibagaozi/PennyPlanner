/**
 * Provides aspect-oriented programming (AOP) components for cross-cutting concerns in the PennyPlanner application.
 *
 * - Contains aspect classes that implement cross-cutting functionality such as authentication,
 * logging, transaction management, and other enterprise concerns that span multiple layers of the application.
 * - Aspects are designed to work seamlessly with Spring's AOP framework to provide clean separation
 * of core business logic from infrastructure concerns.</p>
